# Analyzing-Movies-Reviews-
This shows an analysis between two movies review platform; Fandango and Metacritic.
Fandango vs Metacritic Methodology
Fandango appears to inflate ratings and isn't transparent about how it calculates and aggregates ratings. Metacritic publishes each individual critic rating, and is transparent about how they aggregate them to get a final rating.

Fandango vs Metacritic number differences
The median metacritic score appears higher than the mean metacritic score because a few very low reviews "drag down" the median. The median fandango score is lower than the mean fandango score because a few very high ratings "drag up" the mean.

Fandango ratings appear clustered between 3 and 5, and have a much narrower random than Metacritic reviews, which go from 0 to 5.

Fandango ratings in general appear to be higher than metacritic ratings.

These may be due to movie studio influence on Fandango ratings, and the fact that Fandango calculates its ratings in a hidden way.
